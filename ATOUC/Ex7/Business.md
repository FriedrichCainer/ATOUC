# GanSource just launched the world’s first true General AI Platform
## EdgeTech News - 14th Sep 2054

GanSource couldn’t have timed their announcement more perfectly as it’s almost exactly thirty years since the last Artificial Intelligence hype cycle crashed spectacularly in the early 2020s.

Although self-driving cars and conversational agents are now commonplace it took a stock market crash to teach the general public that machine learning didn’t in any way equate to true Artificial Intelligence.

In those 30 years we’ve had the Ganymede discovery, climate collapse and the Reboot movement; any of which on their own have brought about greater changes to society than what was envisioned by those wearing the rose-tinted AI glasses of the early millennium. Today anyone who suggests that our modern Machine Learning platforms could solve the climate crisis or help with the skilled labor shortages caused by the Reboot would be met with derision and scorn.

It’s against this backdrop that GanSource announced today the release of their highly anticipated General AI Platform based on reclaimed Librarian technology. Recovered from the base of a collapsed glacial valley the Librarian was found crushed under seventeen meters of rubble.

First discovered in video footage from the Ganymede archive dated around 10,870BC, the video was shot from the entrance of a newly formed glacial valley at the end of the Pleistocene Epoch. In the distance a single Librarian can be seen following a herd of woolly rhinoceros when suddenly one of the steep walls of the valley, newly exposed by the retreating glacier, collapsed without warning.

Initially the Reboot nations who control Ganymede tried to claim that the location of the Librarian was their own intellectual property but thankfully researchers discovered that the valley shown in the footage was private land within what was once the Montana Glacier National Park. It took only three months to uncover the wreck but since then most efforts have been on reverse engineering the General AI code that the Librarians ran on.

GanSource CEO Fleur Ingersoll commented on some of the issues faced in this process. In its raw form the AI code has what Ingersoll describes as “a form of AI autism; its purpose is to see patterns, make connections and develop concepts but everything is equally fascinating to it.” This inability to prioritise focus has been the key roadblock to productizing the Librarian software.

“Initially we were looking for some sort of reward/punishment system or similar control logic but we couldn’t find it in the code. What we did find was a massive predictive model that on its own didn’t seem to serve any purpose. It was only once we combined the two systems that we realised that the predictive model was like a spam checker, rejecting trains of thought that weren’t useful.”

Ingersoll went on to use the glacier footage as an example. Tracking the seven woolly rhinos up the valley was fine but ruminating on the fact that seven is a prime number was not. GanSource researchers theorize that the model was built upon a huge dataset of recorded actions by the Librarians’ creators which encoded both a moral framework and their “common sense”.

“The trouble, of course, was that we couldn’t productize the code using the original model. The Librarians were purely observers and researchers, after all. Thankfully we had exactly the dataset needed to train our own model. Pulling together terabytes of workplace correspondence, corporate charters and business process documents, we created a truly Enterprise-Ready AI solution.”

GanSource intends the platform to act as a force multiplier for non-managerial positions freeing up corporate leadership to focus on the company's long term strategic vision and goals.

This couldn’t come at a better time for those organisations suffering from staffing issues caused by the Reboot’s skilled worker visa program. Reached for comment the CEO of Rochai Industries, who was part of the Beta program, said, “Shareholders are going to love this. People today with economically valuable skills can demand outrageous salaries or simply defect to the Reboot. This finally gives those people some much needed and healthy competition.”

While some have raised concerns of AI run amok or other doomsday scenarios, Ingersoll was quick to dissuade these concerns. “Fundamentally, this doesn’t change anything but the speed companies can run at, after all, corporations are already a form of slow AI. If they need to speak they hire a PR rep, if they need to write a contract they hire a lawyer. Even the CEO is just another tightly defined role. Our General AI Platform doesn’t change this, it just increases the speed at which they operate and how quickly they can return value to their shareholders.”

## Press Release - 25th Aug 2067

CORONA, Calif., Aug. 25, 2067 (TORCH NEWSWIRE) -- Plonk Beverage Corporation, (NASDAQ: PLNK) makers of the wildly popular line of Cana-ffeine wellness drinks, announced today their latest extreme influencer marketing initiative by taking Cana-ffeine to the stars!

Having won concessions from the Reboot nations to send one person through the Ganymede launch facility the UN then sold these rights in a free market auction. Plonk outbid all other competitors such as NASA, Alphabet and CAS pledging to “Bring the flavor” to the Librarians’ creators.

In partnership with the World eSports Federation they will be sending Jonah Abbott, 2067 World Champion, as their emissary of flavor. Jonah will be streaming his 120 day trip to Ganymede aboard the next Reboot VASIMIR resupply ship. Once on Ganymede he and 100 cans of Cana-ffeine will be sent to the stars!
