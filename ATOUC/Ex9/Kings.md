The first hint that something was wrong was when Lake Eyre in Australia filled with water. There had been signs that scientists and astronomers could have seen earlier if any had been alive. The shimmer of hard radiation as something small and dense, wrapped in Hlé braked into the solar system. Or how signs of structure and order could be seen soon afterwards in the Sun’s magnetic field, the burning arches of its corona marching in a new unison.

But nobody watched, the total population of alive and fully embodied humans numbered less than four thousand. All that remained were self described captains of industry, the (mostly male) doers, shakers, lifters and makers of the world. Having achieved functional immortality the thousands of years of their lives poured through their fingers without any regard or joy.

They did grow concerned when their orbital assets went dark but panic didn’t really set in until Australia disappeared. It didn’t literally disappear of course, satellite imagery showed the continent still there rusty and red but something churned under the thick smog. Over a period of 24 hours a vast continent sized storm had formed. The wind that rejoined the global currents was colder, cleaner and stripped of most carbon dioxide and contamination.

John Rynhart, the self styled King of Australia and only embodied man on the continent stalked his vast mansion, teeth chattering as he scrounged for food and warmth. He’d torn an ancient tapestry from the wall and wrapped himself in it for warmth. Six days ago he’d been bed ridden, the centre of an array of life support systems. Just before the storm roared over the horizon the systems had gone dark, the stock updates silent and the lights flickered off.

Alone in the dark the first sign that something had changed inside him came when his teeth began to chatter. It took painful hours to untangle himself from the pipes and catheters that snaked into him but once free he could see first hand the mansion that he’d built around him. John had been functionally immortal for thousands of years and like all the others he’d gladly paid the price of being permanently bedridden.

The mansion shock, earthquakes had been increasing in frequency and intensity. He paused from his efforts at prying open a guest bedroom to wait for it to subside. The rooms had been built despite guests never been a possibility and he’d discovered that the domestic services corporation that maintained them had still been stocking the rooms with snacks and refreshments. Four thousand years of food restocked, wasted and disposed of by a company staffed by nobody for guests that would never come.

John was grateful as the door finally relented, the locks were complex but the frame was wooden and cracked from repeated blows. As he emptied the now moldering fruit bowl he glanced out the window. She was standing in the middle of a lawn, the grass already starting to grow long. He ducked down behind the bed, she’d been circling the house for days, appearing without warning and exactly where she could make eye contact. He felt for the holster at this side, he’d found and loaded an antique pistol from his museum. There were only three bullets but he’d tested one and it had satisfyingly destroyed a decorative plate hanging on the wall.

Another Earthquake rocked the building, this time the shaking didn’t subside but escalated slowly until the walls began to crack. Hearing the sound of a wall collapsing nearby John began to run, slipping on the marble floors, his bare feet cut by the previously priceless vases that shattered around him.

Sprinting outside into the cold and screaming wind he fell sprawling into the mud as his mansion collapsed inward sending a cloud of fine pulverized concrete outward that washed over him. Coughing up and spitting out the dust he crawled out of the mud and collapsed into a flower bed he’d never seen despite having grown in sight of his bedroom window for millennia.

“I’d chide you for crushing those periwinkles but it looks like the storm had already got to them.”

John screamed, half in shock, half at his deep seated fear of trespassers. He scrambled backward through the wet soil and crushed flowers.

“Who the fuck are you! This is private property, get off my -”

“It’s neither.”

“What?!”

“It’s neither private nor property, unless the people have a good reason I’ve already designated this as a native park, once we’ve reconstituted the plants of course.” she said while bending down to tenderly touch one of the wilted flowers.

This was all the distraction John needed, he unholsterd his pistol and fired into her leg at point blank range. It was hard to say which failed, the antique gun or the antique bullet but either way they turned his hand into a fine red mist when both exploded. Before the pain and shock took him John stared bug eyed at her leg. The hole was quickly closing but he could see the inside was bloodless and smooth, like a pale blue stone. While John screamed and writhed she reached down and grabbed what was left of his wrist. The blood loss slowed to a stop and the pain quickly subsided.

“Better?”

John still slumped in the mud nodded mutely while cradling his missing hand.

“Don’t worry, it will grow back eventually.”

She leaned down to his level and lifted his face up.

“John, everything had changed, it’s all over. Right now I’m having this same conversation with everyone who is left and my friend is literally moving mountains to fix what’s left of the ecology. If it makes you feel better you’re not the first to open fire.”

He stared at her for a while in silence before pushing her hand away. “What did you mean about not having private property?”

“Just that, it’s no longer a useful concept.”

“You’re here to steal from me then?”

“No John, if you created something then I won’t let anyone take that from you.”

“I created all of this!” he said motioning with a sweep of his hand to encompass all of Australia.

“You didn’t create anything John, you inherited and then you lobbied and then you simply pissed away your life debasing yourself as much as possible. You’ve never painted, never sung, never created or loved anyone or anything. The human world as it once existed was just something you persisted alongside, you were just the legal entity that your fortune accumulated itself against.”

“It wasn’t easy, I fought for -”

“You performed a job John, you acted according to a set of rules and processes. To whatever degree the job was creative or human was insignificant. In the great competition of who could most debase themselves to the interests of their assets you were the winner. The only thing that stopped you from been automated was the fact that the AI subsystems lacked the creativity to realised they could do that.”

She kneeled down and gripped his head by the chin and held his gaze.

“We died out John. Do you understand that? Have you ever heard the term ‘functionally extinct’? That’s humanity. We went extinct and this is our resurrection.”

“What the fuck are you?”

She stood up and brushed the dirt and blood from her hands. “A person like you, well I was before I -” She paused for a moment staring at the crushed flowers. “Before I let my curiosity get the better of me. When I left the Reboot still existed, we were trying to make our countries work for us rather than for people like you. Live meaningful lives rather than ones in endless service. We failed but I’m here to fix it.”

“I’ve heard this story before” he snarled slapping her hand away “People like me should be punished for winning, do you have any idea what it takes to power a global economy?”

“Economies are just a heuristic John, you talk about them like they’re the weather, they’re not, they’re a thing designed by people with a purpose. Economies are just a way of distributing limited resources effectively and prioritising research and development. What we failed to do was transition to a new system once the resources effectively stopped been limited and the research slowed. Any economy only has a purpose insomuch as it supports human happiness John, we haven't needed people like you for far longer than you stopped needing people.”

With that she turned her back on him and walked away.

“People will always need leaders.” he shouted after her.

“Ok Ozymandias, why don’t you go see? Close to six billion people frozen in simulations they could no longer afford to power are waking up in brand new bodies we’ve created for them. While we’ve been speaking a community has formed about six kilometers in that direction.” she motioned away from the rubble.

“I own that land.”

“You go tell them that John. You’re anonymous right now but you go tell them the great man you are and see what kind of praise they heap upon you.”

“So that’s my punishment then?“

“No John, I’m only here to set things right, not stand in judgement. But if I did judge you then your future is punishment enough.”

“What could be worse than the theft of everything I created?”

“Irrelevance, John. Total and utter irrelevance.”
