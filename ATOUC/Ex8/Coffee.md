#### Ganymede

In the Librarian’s archive they found little footage of Ganymede itself but in the background of one recovered clip was something that drew special interest. Rising from an otherwise unremarkable building was a sphere that accelerated and shot free of Ganymede’s gravity. The building was quickly located and simply named the GLF for Ganymede Launch Facility.

“Not for science, but for coffee”

“For… oh right, yeah to hell with exploring the cosmos, you just want a decent brew.” Jennifer laughed. From behind a safety screen they observed the industrial drill that was making slow progress against the blue surface of the hull.

“Exactly, back home I’d buy half a kg of beans per month just for myself. You know how much our entire powdered caffeine supply is for these disgusting energy drinks? Four kilos, so the weight allowance I’d need just for myself instead keeps the entire base wired for over a year.”

“Right, so you’re sitting here drilling into a literal alien spacecraft in the name of coffee.”

“Worth it.”

They huddled around the power exchange for warmth, despite heated suits and boots the cold of Ganymede always reached them. The drill had been running for hours now and was making a slow but steady progress against the hull. The ship was an opaque sphere in the middle of a classically Camp Gany building, cavernous, empty and blue. The only notable feature was a smooth depression in the floor in which the ship sat like a marble.

“What’s it drilling into?”

“So far the team in charge of that is just calling it ‘exotic carbon’, in other words they have no idea. It’s incredibly hard but we suspect it’s designed for other properties like radiation shielding.”

Catherine leaned over the drill control panel readout. “Hmm… heat is rising, do you think -”

Jennifer only had enough time to slam Catherine to the floor before the drilled whined and then shattered. Shrapnel from the smashed bit pinged against the walls and one piece lodging itself deep into the safety screen like a tiny throwing knife.

Once the smoke had cleared and having confirmed the drill unit was safe to approach Jennifer slowly removed the drill tip from the hole with a pair of pliers. “Weird, it feels like it’s stuck in tar.”

“Would that smash the bit?”

“One made of titanium like this one?”. Jennifer shook her head as she shone a light into the hole and squinted.

“What can you see?”

“Nothing”

“So it got stuck in the hull?”

“No it got through, but beyond that is nothing, just literally nothing.”

#### 13 days later

The small hole was now festooned with equipment; lasers, microwaves, x-rays and various other sensors and scanners. Everything they’d radiated into the sphere just disappeared, each sensor could get a reading from the outer surface but nothing was reflected back from the inside. On the 13th day however they started to receive a radio signal back, faint and noisy it attracted the curiosity of many of the scientists working across the base on their own projects.

“It’s not just the signal’s power that’s increasing, the spectrum is also increasing, six hours ago we were just getting ultra low frequency radio waves but now it’s three hundred megahertz and climbing. We’ve got news from processing as well, they’ve found a simple signal. It was easy to miss at first as it’s constantly shifting frequencies. Three pulses followed by a pause and repeating 10 times per second.” said Charles who was part of the sensor analysis team.

“You sure about that?” asked Jennifer, Charles simply nodded mutely in mild annoyance.

“That’s the signal we’ve been sending via the lasers for weeks now. We need another probe.”

“We’ve done that already, countless times, everything we’ve put in their either comes back broken or doesn’t report anything.” said Charles in a slightly exasperated tone.

“Something simpler then.” Jennifer walked over to the tables covered in equipment and removed another drill bit. Putting on a welding helmet she held the drill bit under a flame until it glowed white. After moving aside the sensors she carefully inserted the still glowing bit. Going back to the equipment table she took a handheld laser thermometer and showed everyone the reading from the other end of the bit.

“Ok, so it’s cooling, what are we testing here?”

“I’m not sure yet but I’ve got a feeling we’ll know in a moment.” She kept the thermometer aimed at the end of the bit sticking out of the hole until the temperature dropped below 50C. Using the pliers she then removed the bit and held it up, the end still glowing bright white.

“Time. The field isn’t some black body soaking everything up, it’s an area of extreme time dilation.” Jennifer looked back worriedly at the sphere. “Ida, what’s the Wattage of that microwave sensor?”

“Not that high, you could safely… ah shit.”

“I’m not following, what’s the problem?”

Jennifer dropped the drill bit and rolled the sensors back in front of the hole. “What can we see Charles?”

“Jesus, it’s Microwaves now, the power coming out is on an order of magnitude higher than before”

“Ok, set the sensors to gather everything and stream it to the Camp servers. Everyone please listen carefully and move quickly, you have two minutes to exit via the airlock, do not pack up your work, do not waste time with questions.”

Jennifer was relieved to see her team moving quickly and suiting up without complaint, they exited the airlock and started walking across the ice towards the main residential structure.

“Ok, so fill us in, why did we have to leave, none of those sensors are dangerous, you could aim most of them right at you without harm.”

“You’re only thinking about the wattage, it’s the joules that matter. We’ve been pouring energy into that sphere for weeks now, energy that most likely was red-shifted into something much more dangerous. For all we know -” The scuffed surface of the ice sheet beneath them suddenly filled with fine spider web of cracks. Looking behind them they saw the blue sphere of the launch facility crowned by a pillar of fire. Ganymede lacking enough atmosphere for sound meant that they watched it in silence, only broken by their own breathing.

Despite the muted explosion it took awhile for them to realise Catherine was weeping. When they accessed the data that had been uploaded to the servers in the moments before the explosion they found images the sensors finally collected as the Hlé field collapsed. It consisted of a single frame, a dozen people wreathed in fire, the events of the past two weeks compressed for them into two seconds of pain.

“Think of it as a redemptive act, you weren’t at fault for what happened but if we can’t convince you of that then at least let us offer you a chance at doing something that may feel like you’ve set it right.”

Catherine stared at the team of people who had just arrived on the most recent supply ship. They worked methodically at securing away their equipment. “I thought Reboot didn’t have a Military.”

“We don’t, they’re all ex-Military just like you.”

“If they’re not officially military then what does Reboot call them, soldier-scientists?”

“Something like that, it’s a team the Reboot member nations formed for… special circumstances.”

“And you want me to join?”

“We need you to join, you have the experience, the background and let’s be blunt, you’re here, not months of travel away.”

“Why the rush? The launch facility has only just finished repairing itself, in fact I’d much rather we study how it did that before trying to use it.”

 “Catherine, we’re in trouble. The Paperclips still control the majority of the world’s resources but Reboot is left looking after 99.99% of the population. Without our food aid their citizens would starve and they’ve gone back to using fossil fuels. Even worse the refugees, especially those from the former United States are not integrating. We now have right-wing political parties in Reboot, people are voting for the systems that they fled from. In this Ganymede has not gone unnoticed, they sent their new AI agents to negotiate at the climate crisis talks and access to the launch facility was a concession they demanded.”

“Christ, what do they intend to send through, an invasion?”

“No, this is the Paperclips. They auctioned the rights and the winner was a soda company that used it as a prize for a video game tournament. It’s a perfect example of what the Reboot stands against, they’re incredible effective at achieving profoundly stupid goals. The Librarians knew us better than we knew ourselves, they predicted all of this was going to happen, the AI agents of course are just speeding it up.”

“Well thankfully they can’t send their ‘Intelligent Agents’. The launch facility will only construct a ship when it detects a person and just having something person shaped won’t do.”

“Isn’t fooled by a crash test dummy?”

“No dice, it has a dedicated machine learning model just for detecting people and it isn’t tricked easily. Why the rush though? The Hlé will effectively pause time for them but not for us. Even if these spheres travel at near light speed it’s going to be hundreds, even thousands of years before we hear back.”

“We’re hopeful that’s not the case, we don’t understand Hlé at all, it doesn’t fit into any model of physics we have. If that’s possible why not faster than light travel? We’re confident that our team can make contact with the Librarians creators and get their help to fix the problems the Paperclips have created. We’re calling it a rescue mission for those who were taken but really it’s a rescue project for ourselves.”

#### 237 days later

Catherine and the team cautiously lowered themselves into the bowl shaped depression in the floor of the launch facility. She hadn’t returned since the incident almost a year ago but there were no signs of the destruction she and her team had inadvertently caused. Once they were all inside with their equipment the shape of the depression in the floor changed. It formed a small platform under each person and carefully positioned them together in the middle.

After a quiet minute Catherine broke the silence “So what now, did we exceed the weight lim-”

A black sphere of Hlé snapped into existence around the team. Slowly the blue floor of the room flowed up and around the sphere, encasing it like an eggshell. From a safe distance the scientists and Reboot officials on Ganymede watched as it launched into the sky, backlit by Jupiter on the horizon.

They briefly lost sight of the sphere as it left Ganymede but then quickly found it again after it was illuminated by thousands of points of light. Lasers from dormant Librarian devices in the rings of Jupiter accelerated the sphere out of the solar system. It’s acceleration continued but once it passed Pluto they gave up hope on its ability to travel faster than light.

“If it continues in a stright line then it does eventually intersect perfectly with another star system but it’s… a long way away.”

“How long would the return trip be? If they didn’t spend too much time there?”

“Hmm… lots of assumptions about the sphere’s final speed but four thousand years give or take.”

“So… not a rescue mission then.”

#### ~7.3 x 10^5 days later

The pale blue sphere mirrored the watery planet below as it approached the structure in orbit. Its only greeting was from the automated systems that had guided and powered its decelleration and final approach. Lasers sparkled along the speheres surface shedding its remaining velocity.

At a distance the structure resembled a child's drawing of an eye drawn in blue. The sphere slowed until it gently touched the structure and after a moment's rest was drawn in and merged like a soap bubble.
