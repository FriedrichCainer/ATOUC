<p>Jonah admired his logo jacket whilst his Father admonished him over their final video call. Mostly gaming companies with a few premium hardware and vapes thrown in for good measure. He especially liked how they let him select his favourite brands, the fact they even sent him free products was also incredible.</p>

	<p>“...which makes it the single greatest scientific find in the history of humanity and they sold, no bloody well auctioned, the rights to a soda company. Scientists should be going...”</p>

<p>He just noticed that even the material the logo patches were sewn onto was also covered in a custom pattern containing the same logos. Jonah wondered if they would also give him a matching spacesuit in the same design.</p>

	<p>“...and frankly the fact that blind luck got you into this position does not, and let’s be clear here, make you a fucking astronaut” Jonah responded by leaning back in his chair and exhaling slowly.</p>

	<p>“Won, I won this Dad, it wasn’t luck, there was a competition.”</p>

<p>“A video game you mean.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and millions watched the final match.”</p>

<p>His father opened his mouth to reply before thinking better of it and sitting back. He stared at his son in silence for a few minutes, watching him admire his jacket and other corporate gift’s they’d given him.</p>

	<p>“Why do you want this?”</p>

<p>“It’s my big break dad, you kept saying I needed a real job and -”</p>

	<p>“This isn’t a job, it’s a marketing stunt”</p>

<p>“It’s a job, they’re paying me, I’ll be streaming for the entire trip and they’ll be paying me more money than I’ve ever dreamed of.”</p>

	<p>“Don’t go son.”</p>

<p>“Have to Dad, this is my big break.</p>

<p>“Please, Jonah -”</p>

<p>“Gotta go, I’ll see you when I get back.”</p>

<p>Flashes of heat and strange flickering light woke Jonah moments before the screaming man burst through the curtains and died. His cries were strangled and he slumped upright between the curtains for a moment as if suspended by giant hands. When he fell forward seconds later his lower torso was wrapped in a blanket but beneath it looked like he’d been dead for days.</p>

	<p>Jonah turned to his fellow passenger for comfort or at least make sense of what happened but was greeted by something monstrous. It stared straight ahead in silence, a face formed from distended proportions. </p>

<p>A rumbling noise like a kettle on the boil was coming from it’s head and Jonah only just managed to unbuckle and shield himself with his jacket before the thing’s skull exploded into a cloud of steam and viscera. Another explosion behind him made him scream as he commando crawled between the chairs babbling in terror.</p>

	<p>As he rounded the corner into the other aisle his hands slipped on small beads that were pouring into the cabin from behind the curtains. Without thinking he pinched one between his fingers and recoiled as it burst with an acrid stink of biofuel. Furiously wiping his hands he only noticed movement in the seat above him at the last second.</p>

	<p>It was perched on the headrest, hands gripping it like a bird's talons, the lower half was only ragged flaps of wet skin. Jonah could only look up and make a half choking sound before it sung to him. The song was all the respite he needed, it was his mother’s comfort as a child, it was rain while warm in bed. His heart was still hammering in his chest but it slowed as he curled up in the aisle. The beads still flowed around him and the gore rained down in a warm shower.</p>

	<p>The creature carefully picked it’s way down the seat, still singing its lullaby as it nestled in beside him and formed its hands into a ring, a crown fit just for Jonah.</p>

	<p>Jonah’s sleep was disturbed this time by birdsong and running water rather than a screaming corpse. The sheets were wonderfully soft and Jonah lay there for a while enjoying his sleep-in until his final moments caught up with him. Bolting upright and throwing back the covers he found himself dressed in a plain grey pair of track pants and t-shirt.</p>

<p>The bed was sitting in the middle of a small forest glade, the air cool and fragrant with the earthy scent of the forest. The sunlight that filtered through the canopy was warm and a small stream babbled through the glade.</p>

<p>“I hope you slept well?”</p>

<p>Jonah spun around to find where the voice had come from. She stepped out from the edge of the glade, pausing beside a tree before making her way toward him. Dressed in a crisp white pantsuit and matching runners she strode through the grass. Her hair was shaved on both sides and the whole look clearly signalled her position as some sort of corporate executive.</p>

<p>“I can, what -” Jonah stared at his knuckles, his brows writhing.</p>

<p>“It’s ok.” She closed the gap between them and laid a hand on his shoulder “Let’s have breakfast.”</p>

<p>The world dissolved before him as if something oily had gotten in his eye. Blinking furiously his vision cleared and Jonah found himself sitting at a small french bistro table at a cliffside cafe by the sea. The sea crashed against the cliffs far below and seabirds called in the distance. Jonah sat in shocked silence for some time seemingly just staring at the sea birds.</p>

<p>“Am I dead?” he whispered to himself.</p>

<p>“Do you feel dead?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well there you go. You, like almost everyone else here are living in a simulation.”</p>

<p>“Like a video game?”</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>“It feels real.” he said while curiously feeling the edge of the table in front of him.</p>

<p>“The advertisements used to call it ‘realer than real’.” she said while gesturing toward a pen and paper on the table. Jonah couldn’t tell if it had just appeared out of thin air or had always been there. Picking up the pen she drew a perfect circle that filled the page. “This is the extent of what you can perceive with your senses, and this -” she drew a second perfect circle outside the first with just a millimeter gap “ - this is the fidelity of the simulation. You’re real and the experience you’re having is real, isn’t that enough?” She paused for Jonah to ask questions but he simply sat mutely staring down at the paper. “You must be starving, let’s have something to eat.”</p>

<p>Jonah was still looking at the paper when his memories intruded. He remembered the face of the creature, the noise as its skull boiled, the man screaming between the curtain. His hands trembled as he made to get up from the table.</p>

<p>“You ok Jonah? Maybe you’d like to feed the birds? I find the cry of seagulls to be very relaxing.”</p>

<p>He heard the gulls shrieking above the cliffs as they swooped in and out of the sea. It was a grating noise at first but now he focused on it he could hear a pleasing melody in their cries. Sitting back down at the table he watched them for a few minutes before turning back to her.</p>

<p>“What’s your name?”</p>

<p>“Call me Lynndie.”</p>

<p>“I think I would like something to eat.”</p>

<p>“Wonderful, what were we thinking, sweet or savoury?”</p>

<p>“Savoury”</p>

<p>“Cultured macro breakfast bowl? Kale salad? Pumpkin Frittata?” she listed as Jonah pulled a face.</p>

<p>“No, more like -” he started before she cut him off with a raised hand.</p>

<p>“Ah, you know what, there is a better option. I haven’t introduced you to the best part, here, this is the user agreement.” she gestured to another sheet of paper that had appeared on the table. It was covered in fine writing and with a flick of her finger the text scrolled rapidly until a small box appeared titled “Press to sign”.</p>

<p>“What is this?”</p>

<p>“This is the EULA agreement for the luxury component of this simulation. Here you can have anything you want, and I mean anything.” she emphasised with a wink. “But everything is not enough, what if you could have exactly what you want before you even know you want it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand, is this giving you permission to read my thoughts?”</p>

<p>Lynndie laughed like a steel chain falling into a metal bowl. “Not at all, this simulation in only one of many. Why have only one Jonah when we could have two, or two hundred? All we do is spin up a copy of yourself, ask a single question such as ‘Would you like coffee or tea?’ and then shut it down.”</p>

<p>“Oh, wow, I ah don't think that sounds -”</p>

<p>“No no, I get it.” Lynndie said with both hands raised “It’s already enough work just being one Jonah, you’re worried who would own your stuff when there is two of you? You’re worried if it will hurt getting shut down after the question is asked? All of these issues are covered in the EULA, for legal purposes there only ever exists one Jonah, the second copy can only run for 90 seconds and has no legal rights to your property. It has all your memories and once the ninety seconds is up it just ceases to exist, no pain. Would you like a trial?”</p>

<p>“A trial?”</p>

<p>“Yes, just a one off try-before-you-buy type arrangement, we’ll only need your verbal consent.”</p>

<p>Jonah glanced at the birds, their screeching almost drowned out the waves, Lynndie was right that it was incredibly relaxing.</p>

<p>“Sure, ok, let’s try.” Nothing seemed to happen but then Jonah smelled the coffee, looking down it was sitting on the table in front of him in his favourite mug from home. The smell was floral and exotic unlike the acrid canned stuff he was used to.</p>

<p>“See, no discussion about whether you’d like coffee or tea, it’s just what you wanted without having to even think about it.”</p>

<p>Jonah sniffed the coffee experimentally and then leaned back in his chair slowly. “It smells good, really good. How did you know about my mug?”</p>

<p>“Well that’s the trick, we just asked you. This simulation was paused, we ran a second copy and had a chat about what you’d like. Most of the time available was used just describing that mug. Now, do you consent to this service going forward? You can disable it at any point of course.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, sure, that would be great.” Before him appeared a croissant stuffed with melted Gruyere and honey ham. Jonah experimentally tasted the edge before demolishing half in a few bites.</p>

<p>“Wonderful isn’t it, we sampled 47 other foods you hadn’t tried before and landed on this as the most popular.”</p>

<p>“It’s incredible.” Jonah’s eyes narrowed “Is this all free?”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you asked! Yes of course it’s all free, in here everything is free but outside it is still true that time is money. Even the best simulation can’t compete with reality in terms of speed, at the moment we’re running the simulation at top speed which for those who can afford it is around 43% of realtime. Every 26 seconds in here is about a minute outside but the extra simulations bring that down further. It takes time to ask all those questions after all.”</p>

<p>“For those who can afford it? What does running at top speed cost?”</p>

<p>“For now you don’t have to worry about that, not until we get back. But to answer your question we’d typically recommend a sum that would be equivalent in your day to 314 million US dollars.”</p>

<p>“Ok, so I can’t afford that.”</p>

<p>“Oh I wouldn’t be so certain, your father sued the Plonk corporation over their Cana-ffeine promotion. During the court proceedings a precedent was set that anyone travelling at near lightspeed cannot be declared dead so you are still in full ownership of all your assets.”</p>

<p>“Oh, so I get to keep all that nothing I had.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be so pessimistic Jonah. Our records show you owned some shares of Plonk as part of your prize pool. Those today adjusted for present value are well in excess of the figure needed to run the simulation at top speed. You also had a number of different cryptocurrencies, do you remember purchasing Blagcoins?”</p>

<p>“Nope.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure? When you purchased them they were used in exchange for video game assets and content.”</p>

<p>“There were heaps of coins like that, wouldn’t the shares be worth more?”</p>

<p>“You’d be surprised, so do you remember the passphrase to your Blagcoin wallet?”</p>

<p>“Nope, why the interest in some game currency?”</p>

<p>“Blagcoin was one of the first cryptocurrencies to be hardened against quantum computing attacks.  It was one of the first cryptocurrencies to implement quantum-resistant controls, all others dissolved once sufficiently powerful quantum computers running Shor's algorithm were available.”</p>

<p>“So it was used for more than just computer game assets?”</p>

<p>“Yes, by 2142 it was the primary currency for Latin America, today those coins would be worth a substantial sum. Now, do you remember the pass phrase for the wallet?”</p>

<p>“I might have had it written down somewhere but yeah, it wasn’t super important.”</p>

<p>“Hmmm… apologies, I’ve been chatting away and you never got to try your coffee.”</p>

<p>Jonah took a tentative sip before nodding appreciatively.</p>

<p>“Does it need sugar?”</p>

<p>“It’s really good but yeah, I like it really sweet.” Jonah added four cubes from a bowel that appeared on the table.</p>

<p>“You know there are a number of ways we could jog your memory, sadly even though this is a simulation we can’t just access your memories. Each memory is encoded within the structure of your brain, the only way to access their information is by simulating you recalling them.”</p>

<p>One of the seabirds landed on the railing beside Jonah, it screeched melodically in his face.</p>

<p>“What you need is something that will stimulate the right part of your brain to make that connection again. A relaxing rest for example, or simulating the environment you were in when you purchased the Blagcoins.” Lynndie said while iterating each of the options on her fingers.</p>

<p>“It’s ok, I’m sure it will come to me at some point.”</p>

<p>Lynndie nodded curtly before unfurling her index finger for the last option. “Or pain, pain is can be very stimulating.”</p>

<p>Jonah began to protest before looking down at Lynndie’s finger, it extended in a crooked line through his right shoulder. He looked over his shoulder at the line of knuckles that extended all the way into the wall behind him. Hand shaking Jonah reached out to touch the finger where it pierced him, it was only then that the pain caught up with him and he began to scream.</p>

<p>“What was the password to the wallet Jonah?” Lynndie asked calmly.</p>

<p>Jonah was lifted from his seat, feet dangling and scrambling for purchase as he kicked the chair away. Slowly an unseen force pushed him along the length of Lynndie’s index finger, the knuckles brushing against the bone. He eventually hit the wall behind him where with a quick gesture Lynndie snapped her index finger cleanly off leaving him pinned to the wall. She remained seated and drank his coffee while waiting for him to stop screaming.</p>

<p>“You, I signed the- you said I had rights!”</p>

<p>“Jonah does, all the rights as afforded to him as a shareholder. You however are just a secondary simulation which Jonah gave us the rights to create.” She winked as she added another cube of sugar. “The contract only stipulates that we can run this for 90 seconds so what’s the password to the wallet Jonah?”</p>

<p>“I don’t fucking know! I don’t remember!”</p>

<p>“4 seconds Jonah, last chance.”</p>

<p>His feet caught fire and he screamed in terror until the simulation ended without fanfare, painlessly.</p>
</br></br>
<p>“Hmmm… apologies, I’ve been chatting away and you never got to try your coffee.”</p>

<p>Jonah took a tentative sip before nodding appreciatively.</p>

<p>“Ha, sweet, just how I like it”</p>

<p>Jonah grinned from ear to ear as the gulls screamed.</p>
