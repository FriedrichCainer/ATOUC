A ‘Trained hypnopompic response’ is what they called it. Like reaching for a pair of glasses in the morning or resetting the alarm in bed. Instead, Catherine woke and immediately began a risk assessment. Before they had left for the mission the training had already ruined her traditional Sunday morning sleep in. The first sign of consciousness and she’d force herself awake and begin her checks. She did a quick scan for immediate threats, followed by a brisk self-check for injuries, and then operational checks.
	Next was a systems check. Under the external layer the suit was a honeycomb of small 50mm cells, 60% energy storage, 20% temperature control, 19% a mix of general computer and redundant storage, with the final 1% a selection of dedicated hardware accelerators for various machine vision, signal processing, and analysis packages.
External components were next; contact lens, haptic gloves, and the comms units on each shoulder. These would attempt to establish and maintain a local network using UHF, ultraviolet light and everything in-between including long-range lasers as the situation demanded.
Finally, the local network was established. Audio was enabled, but she saw the team had joined a local chat channel instead to keep things silent.
Robert >| Good morning ladies and gentlemen.
Robert >| Welcome aboard Gany Air flight 51 bound for who knows where
Robert >| Everyone sit tight
Robert >| I want detailed env reports from all of you first
Frederich >| Looks like Catherine was right, it’s the aircraft cabin scenario
Helen >| Initial rads are fine
Helen >| (obviously or your suits would be screeching about it)
Catherine >| Thank fuck for that, I wasn’t looking forward to scenarios 8 through 22 :)
Robert >| I was holding out hope for scenario 1.
Catherine >| The benevolent benefactor welcome party, well it would have been nice...
Dan >| No 3rd party comms I can see.
Margaret >| Local positioning is up, adding everyone’s location to HUD.
Catherine’s displays already showed everyone was close, but she could now see their relative positions in her display. Robert, Carl, Helen, and Margaret were grouped together at the far end of the cabin with Dan on her row in the far aisle.
Dan >| Everyone please note I have someone sitting beside me, he appears asleep.
Helen >| Yeah I see 2 more in our row
Robert >| Ok hold off interacting for now but they’re only dozing
Robert >| Remember that hlé only knocks you out, it doesn’t sedate
Robert >| Once they wake remember protocol, mask opacity to 100%
Robert >| Be as reassuring as possible, nobody expects to wake up next to a spaceman.
Helen >| Speak for yourself
Margaret >| Detailed atmo is back, Life support is basically the best case scenario
Margaret >| Atmospheric pressure is a comfortable 12psi
Margaret >| Composition the standard 78/21/1 split of Nitrogen, Oxygen and Argon/Trace Margaret >| Trace is a bit off
Margaret >| CO2 very low at 300 parts per million and ozone just a little higher than normal.
Robert >| Perfect, optimal life support scenario
Margaret >| As long as the the proton-exchange membranes can extract oxygen then we won’t have any issues until power runs out, then it’s helmets off.
Carl >| Which I would strongly advise not to, the risk of contamination is very real
Robert >| I’ll take that risk over huffing vacuum any day
Margaret >| Ok so that’s the good news, now for the odd news
Margaret >| There is definitely organic contaminants
Margaret >| But you’ll never guess what it is
Catherine >| Alien musk
Margaret >| Way weirder, cigarette smoke. Not a lot but you’d easily smell it
Catherine >| Makes sense
Catherine >| They have probably been sampling the air from as far back as the 1970s
Catherine >| Smoking wasn’t banned until the 90s
Catherine >| The GAN’s they used to design this place would have split the difference.
Dan >| Team I have a situation
Robert >| Switch to audio if it’s urgent
“I can see someone in my aisle, something is wrong though, they’re... crawling.”
“Ok sit tight, can you see any signs of injury?”
“Hold on, I need to switch to night vision… ah, ok, shit, fuck.”
“Keep talking Dan, what can you see”
“It’s a person- or no, I don’t know, it’s fucking huge Rob. It’s watching me, it’s not moving and it’s just watching me talk to you.”
“Keep going, describe it”
“Muscles, like a sprinter but the face is, I can’t describe it, horrible, beautiful? It’s absolutely not human but it looks like… I don’t know, a bad copy of one?”
Catherine could see Dan in her row, with her night vision switched on she could see him leaning into the aisle. She tried to see if she could see anything reflected in his helmet but couldn’t make anything out.
“Ok team, looks like we have first contact already. Dan I’ll need you to slowly take out your contact tablet, stand up very slowly and place it in the aisle. Then you’re going to need to disengage, leave your chair and walk backward two rows, cross to the other aisle and make your way over to us.”
Each member of the team had a small tablet intended for this event. On one side was an aluminium engraving containing an updated version of the Pioneer plaque, a series of pictograms introducing humanity, and how the tablet functioned. On the other side was a computer tablet that also attempted to establish wireless communication. The standards that it used were exhaustively explained in an engraving only visible under a microscope. The tablets left out most of the more salacious details about humanity and instead focused on providing a Rosetta Stone of sorts for communication.
	Catherine watched as Dan carefully got out of his seat, removed the tablet strapped to his leg, and slowly lowered it into the aisle. He then started to back away when suddenly there was a scream from the man who had been seated beside him. He was sitting up now and looking through the gap between the seats.
	“Sir please be quiet, it’s just a spacesuit My name is Dan Sawant and -”
Catherine realised too late that the man was looking behind Dan as a figure rose until it towered a full foot above him. The team heard a gasp from Dan before its hands connected with either side of his helmet. There was a crack and sudden rip as it twisted the helmet with a snap and then kicked him forward tearing the helmet free.
	While this happened the creature in the aisle leapt up to the top of the seats and pounced on the man still screaming. The second threw Dan’s helmet aside, stepped over him and chased another of the passengers who was attempting to flee.
	“Catherine, can you see Dan?” Robert shouted as he and the rest of the team started to scramble from their seats.
	“Yes, I’m making my way over now”
Margaret >| “Vitals show he’s still ok but likely in shock”
Catherine reached Dan in the aisle, one of the creatures was dragging the man still screaming down the aisle.
	“Dan, get up, we need to move!”
Dan looked dazed as Catherine helped him to his feet. The seats were empty now with the team and passengers driven into the next cabin or dragged into the one behind. They made their way up the aisle in the direction the rest of the team had gone. At the far end of the cabin was a curtain which Catherine opened and lead Dan through before remembering his helmet. She went back to grab it and when she headed back she saw that he was still standing in the galley staring at the floor.
	“Dan, I know you’re still in shock but we need -”
Walking into the galley where Dan was standing she found herself face to face with one of the creatures, standing perfectly still. She could hear it speaking to Dan and Catherine found herself compelled to turn up the volume. The language was like nothing she had ever heard before; it was like poetry interspersed with animal noises and scratching insectile clicks.
	Catherine carefully unclipped her helmet and after placing it on the floor followed in silence as the creature led them down the aisle. They walked in silence for a while passing through cabins until the crack of a gunshot rang out. The creature paused as if considering the noise before turning to Dan.
Catherine watched as the creature began to work on something with its hands. It made a circle shape between thumbs and index fingers and with a motion like the child's game of Cat's Cradle, a fine spider web began to form. While it did this the creature continued to intone. The speech was musical and uplifting to hear. Catherine smelt burning hair as it lowered its hands onto Dan’s head like a crown.
	She watched on in rapt attention as the cobwebs between its hands dissolved everything it touched. First Dan’s hair, skin, and finally bone until his brain stood exposed. She could see the rhythmic movement of his pulse in the fine veins covering its surface. Here the crown slowed, the cobwebs drifting across the surface as if pushed by a breeze. Slowly his brain evaporated, new portions revealed as if melting. The blood when visible was wicking across the cobwebs and up to the creatures wrists where it poured in torrents.
	She focused on the wrists until the blood slowed to a trickle. Dan was still standing, his face placid and at ease. The creature’s hands were around his neck now, and just as she began to wonder if Dan was still standing under his own power the creature let him go. His body hit the floor like a sack of meat. Catherine saw now that his face was little more than a mask. Behind it was nothing but a deep cavity where his thoughts once lingered.
The creature now turned to her but before it could raise its hands another shot rang out. Again the creature looked ahead in the direction of the shot and seemed to consider. When it turned back to Catherine the singing changed. She remembered wolves hunting in the snow, impossible choices made after failed harvests, diseases and disfigurements. Her head was clear now. She knew what she had seen, she knew she had done nothing and only terror of the hunting wolf gripped her. It turned away, ignoring her as she ran.
	Dark cabins and bright galleys were a blur as she raced for somewhere to hide. Eventually, she picked a row and huddled against the bulkhead between chairs. She removed the sick bag from the seat pocket and breathed into it until she stopped hyperventilating.
	Part of the storage and compute resources in her suit was a research suite containing pattern matching software and large databases of everything from animal recordings to an entire offline copy of Wikipedia. Catherine unwrapped an energy bar which she ate thoughtfully while running the software against the recording of the creature's speech the suit had automatically taken.
	After resting on the floor for some time, waiting for the suit to tell her what it had found, she was shocked to see another passenger calmly walk past her in the opposite aisle. As quietly as possible she made her way into the the aisle and followed him into the galley. She watched from behind the curtain as he searched the cabin. Suddenly he made eye contact with her, waved, and yelled out.
“We need to wake the others, something is wrong!”
 She urgently motioned him to be quiet and ducked back behind the curtain. Just then her suit notified that it had found a match and provided a link:
